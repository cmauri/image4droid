# image4droid

Library to decode BMP/ICO/CUR files into a list of Bitmap-objects. This library has been adapted from [image4j project](https://github.com/imcdonagh/image4j "image4j") to work on Android. Only the decoding part has been kept.

The original README file follows: 

# image4j

## Overview

The image4j library allows you to read and write certain image formats in 100% pure Java.

Currently the following formats are supported:

* BMP (Microsoft bitmap format - uncompressed; 1, 4, 8, 24 and 32 bit)
* ICO (Microsoft icon format - 1, 4, 8, 24 and 32 bit [XP uncompressed, Vista compressed])

## Purpose

This project aims to provide:

* an open source library for handling various image formats in Java
* with a commercial-friendly license
* using only Java code, ie. without using any JNI hacks
* with no dependencies on third-party libraries (where possible)

## License

The image4j library is licensed under the GNU LGPL v2.1 so you are free to use it in your Free Software and Open Source projects, as well as commercial projects, under the terms of the LGPL v2.1.

## History

This project began after I spent hours searching for a library that would meet the above criteria and found that there is probably no such thing - or at least, not any more. The only support I could find for the ICO format was read-only, so doing cool stuff - like generating favicons on the fly - using only Java code was not possible.

## QuickStart

It is possible to decode/encode BMP and ICO files with just one line of code!

The image4j library consists of only Java code and has no dependencies on third-party libraries, so you just add it to the classpath and you're good to go.

Although the code is compatible with Java 1.5.0 or later, it should be relatively simple to port the code to an older version, eg. 1.4.2.

### BMP

#### Decode


```java
BufferedImage image = BMPDecoder.read(new File("input.bmp"));
```

#### Encode

```java
BMPEncoder.write(image, new File("output.bmp"));
```

### ICO

#### Decode

```java
List<BufferedImage> image = ICODecoder.read(new File("input.ico"));
```

#### Encode

```java
ICOEncoder.write(images, new File("output.ico"));
```
